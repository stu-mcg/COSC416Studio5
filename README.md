# Game Development Studio #5: Breakout Game

**Course:** COSC416A Game Dev with Unity  
**Made By:** Chase Winslow, Jordan Truong, Preston Melvin, Stuart McGorman

## About This Project

In this studio, we followed a tutorial to build a classic Breakout game.  
We applied the skills learned in previous Unity assignments to create a dynamic breakout experience featuring responsive paddle controls and an engaging ball-and-brick system enhanced with sounds, particles, camera shake, and a lives HUD.

## Implemented Functions:

### Player Paddle Movement:
- A/D or Arrow Keys to move the paddle horizontally
- Smooth, responsive controls for precise positioning

### Ball and Brick Dynamics:
- Ball bounces off the paddle and walls with realistic physics
- Bricks break upon impact with the ball, disappearing from the playfield

### Added Features:
- **Sounds:** Integrated sound effects for ball collisions, brick breaks, and ambient background music
- **Particles:** Particle effects triggered upon brick destruction for a visually dynamic experience
- **Camera Shake:** Brief camera shake on impactful collisions to enhance game feedback
- **Lives on HUD:** A display showing the remaining lives, adding an extra layer of challenge
